##Problem Description:
"Looking towards the large count of Govt Universities, State universities, Private universities and Deemed to be universities, there should be a system / portal that would clearly show affiliation of universities, authentic recognition status and programmes being offered. This should also clearly highlight fake universities from time to time and on query based. This will make system more effective and help stakeholders in making right choice. The main focus of this problem statement is to 1. An automated system for the HEIs / Universities to submit their updated Gazette notification / EoA / approval letter along with current intake capacity of the approved courses / programmes 2. Stakeholder can browse the University / HEIs approval status including offering courses / intake capacity and admission procedures A gateway for stakeholders to choose a correct institute for taking admission or other purposes. A parallel platform just like Association of Indian Universities."
